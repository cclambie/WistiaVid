Wistia Vid Readme

v0.1
To use Plugin install and then on page you wish to place the Wistia Vid put shortcode [wistiavid id=xxxxx mailchimp=yyyyy]

xxxxx being the Wistia Video ID, this can be found in the URL of the video on Wistia and the yyyyy being the relevant mailchimp list id as per Wistia Embed interface code.

Eg. http://smallbusinesswebsites.wistia.com/medias/q509p384zl
The ID of this video is q509p384zl therefore the shortcode for the video is [wistiavid id=q509p384zl]
as found on this page: http://www.smallbusinesswebsites.org.au/about-us/

Why I did this?
The Wistia Plugin caused me great pains.  I tried a few other code snippet plugins, but they then caused issues with "other" plugins.

Known issues:
- "Add this" plugin can cause an error with conflicts in Jquery or Wistia JS files

Future Issues: Please notify me: craig+wistiavid@whatwasthat.com.au

Future Enhancements:
- Ability to add and edit player like on Wistia website
- Player Customisation
- Social Sharing
- Call to Action
- Capture Email
